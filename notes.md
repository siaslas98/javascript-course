- onclick attribute applied to an html element allows executing js code.
- === and == whats the difference ? == tries to convert both values to the same type.
-  The same is true with !== and != .
- use const by default for variables and let if going to change value later.
- var was also used previously, but it doesn't follow scope rules and can cause naming conflicts.
